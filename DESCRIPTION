Description: Includes support for 'Mapbox' Navigation APIs, including directions, 
  isochrones, and route optimization; the Search API for forward and reverse geocoding; 
  the Maps API for interacting with 'Mapbox' vector tilesets and visualizing 
  'Mapbox' maps in R; and the 'tippecanoe' tile-generation utility. 
  See <https://docs.mapbox.com/api/> for more information about the 'Mapbox' APIs.
